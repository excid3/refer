# Refer

Referral codes and affiliate links for Ruby on Rails applications.

## 📦 Installation
Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "refer"
```

And then execute:
```bash
$ bundle
```

Add Refer to your controllers to store referral cookies:
```bash
bin/rails generate refer:install
```

And add Refer to your model:
```bash
bin/rails generate refer:model User
bin/rails db:migrate
```

## 🧑‍💻 Usage

Refer adds a model to your Rails application for tracking referrals and referral codes.

To track referrals, you'll need to

1. Create a referral code
2. Set a cookie with the referral code
3. Create the referral
4. (Optional) Provide a reward for successful referral

##### Create a referral code

You can create referral codes through the association:

```ruby
user.referral_codes.create #=> randomly generated code
user.referral_codes.create(code: "chris")
```

To customize the referral code generator:

```ruby
Refer.code_generator = ->(referrer) { [referrer.id, SecureRandom.alphanumeric(8)].join("-") }
#=> generates codes like "1-7frb5fUw"
```

By default, Refer will generate 8 character alphanumeric codes.

##### Set a referral cookie

To track users, we need to stash the referral code in a cookie when present. By default, Refer will look for `?ref=code` and save this in a cookie.

```ruby
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  set_referral_cookie
end
```

Move `set_referral_cookie` to specific controllers if you'd only like cookies set in certain areas like marketing pages for example.

```ruby
class MarketingController < ActionController::Base
  set_referral_cookie except: [:about_us]
end
```

You can customize the param name with:

```ruby
Refer.param_name = :ref
```

You can customize the cookie name with:

```ruby
Refer.cookie_name = :refer_code
```

##### Refer a user:

To create a referral, you can run the following

```ruby
class RegistrationsController < ApplicationController
  def create
    @user = User.new(user_params)
    if @user.save
      refer @user #=> Looks up cookie and attempts referral
      redirect_to root_path
    else
      render :new, status: :unprocessable_entity
    end
  end
end
```

You can also do this manually:

```ruby
Refer.refer(code: "referral_code", referee: user)
```

Refer will make sure the user has not already been referred and create a Referral.

##### Check if a user was referred already:

```ruby
Refer.referred?(user)
#=> true/false
```

##### Accessing Referrals

To access a user's referrals, you can use the `referrals` association:

```ruby
user.referrals #=> [Refer::Referral, Refer::Referral]
```

This returns a list of `Refer::Referral` objects.

##### Accessing Referral

To access a user's referral, you can use the `referral` association:

```ruby
user.referral #=> Refer::Referral
```

To access a user's referrer, you can use `referrer`:
```ruby
user.referrer #=> User that referred this User
```
## Refer with Devise

To use Refer with Devise, you'll need to customize the Devise controller to track the referral after a successful registration.

We can do this by telling Devise to use a custom controller in the routes and hooking into the `create` action to track the referral.

```ruby
# config/routes.rb
devise_for :users, controllers: { registrations: "users/registrations" }
```

```ruby
# app/controllers/users/registrations_controller.rb
class Users::RegistrationsController < Devise::RegistrationsController
  def create
    super do
      refer resource if resource.persisted?
    end
  end
end
```

## Providing Referral Rewards

There are several common ways of handling rewards for successful referrals:

* Immediate rewards
When the referral is successfully created, you can immediately credit the referrer with their reward.

* Reward after user actions
You can check if a user was referred after they complete the action and provide a reward to the referrer.

* Time-based rewards
To provide a reward X days after a successful referral, you can use a schedule job to check for referrals X days ago and provide rewards to those referrers.

We recommend keeping records for each reward given to a referral so you can limit rewards.
